These cash advances often include a fee as well, either a flat rate or a percentage of the advanced amount. Additionally, if you use an ATM to access the cash, you might be charged a small usage fee.

Credit card companies treat cash advances as separate from purchases, with their own separate balances on your account statement. Your monthly payments can be applied to both balances, but if you only pay the minimum amount due, the card issuer is allowed by federal law to apply it to the balance with the lower interest rate. As that is invariably the rate for purchases, the cash advance balance can sit and accrue interest at its high rate for months.

Any payments you make that are over the minimum must first be applied to the highest interest balance, so paying more than the minimum will help you reduce your debt faster.
