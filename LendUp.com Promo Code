The most common form of cash advance today involves borrowing against your credit card's line of credit. You can withdraw the money at an ATM or, in some cases, use a check that you deposit or cash at a bank, commonly known as a convenience check. Credit card cash advances usually carry an interest rate that is higher than the rate for regular purchases on that same card. What's more, the interest typically begins to accrue immediately, with no grace period.
